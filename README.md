Hello, welcome to my game, The Maze. This is a game currently in testing, and I would appreciate your help. I would like the camera to focus on the player. If you have any ideas, please feel free to share them. ^^

About my game: It’s a maze game. For now, there are only basic movements and a collision system.

Future Version: In this game, there will be an entire maze to explore, with collision blocks, 
continuous movement using a key-hold system. There will be destructible environment elements like rocks,
and you’ll be able to cut vines with certain tools like a machete and a pickaxe, which you can obtain by talking to NPCs.
The future versions will be rich in content—if I manage to achieve it! Here’s a list of all the elements I wish to integrate.
Game Objective: Find the lost cats in the maze, and find the exit. Secondary Objectives: Collect coins, collect rubies, find equipment to progress, find a hidden dinosaur, and find a pineapple.

Player Movement: I need a movement system for up, left, down, and right. I already have a system, but I need a system where the player continues to move when a key is held down,
as well as an image button system represented by arrows to move as well.

Camera: I need a camera that zooms in on the player, perhaps with a transition effect, and that follows the player.
I also need an image button to recenter the view on the player, with the image visible in the bottom right.

Viewport: I need a viewport with two scrollbars to explore the area (I tried, but the problem is that my images disappear).

Collision: I need a better collision system than the current one; my character passes through the top and left edges. 
Perhaps a collision system via hotspots would be better? Or staying with a system that allows each lab_block to be a collision zone.

Environment Elements:

Leaves: The leaves should be cut with a machete to pass through.
Rocks: The rocks should be broken with a pickaxe to pass through.
Door: Can only be opened with 3 keys.
Rewards: Rewards can be gold, rubies, or random rewards.
Cross: With a shovel, you can dig for treasure hidden under a cross.
Teleporter: Teleports to another linked teleporter.
Boat: Allows crossing water.
Objects:

Machete: Used to cut leaves.
Pickaxe: Used to break stones.
Shovel: Can dig anywhere.
Key: With multiple keys, you can open the door.
NPCs: There are NPCs that will speak with a speech bubble above their heads. By using the gold collected in the maze and answering their riddle, you will collect an item depending on the NPC.

Zones:

Inverted Zone: In these zones, your controls are reversed.
Fog Zone: In these zones, your character moves underneath a fog rectangle with reduced visibility.
Corridor: Water zones (blue) can only be crossed by boat.
I would need these elements in a single version so that I can understand the code mechanics.
If you don't understand everything but have the ability to solve one problem among all those I've mentioned,
I would be delighted to see your solution. I thank you in advance for your attention and help.
Here is the link to the game with the source code; 
it will be updated each time a problem is solved or with each addition on my part. Thank you very much."
